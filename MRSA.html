                    MRSA is a type of Staph Infection that cannot be treated with antibiotics such as: Penicillin. This is why it is called Methicillin resistant. Healthy people with no cuts, abrasions, or breaks on their skin are at low risk for getting infected. MRSA affects both adults and children and about 2% of people have it. MRSA can cause deep and life-threatening infections in some people. MRSA can be picked up in the general community and in health care facilities. MRSA can cause wound infections after surgery, pneumonia, or infections of catheters inserted into veins. Invasive MRSA infections include soft tissue infections, heart valve infections, and more. Rates of MRSA bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients fell nearly 50% from 1997-2007 since hospitals began using prevention measures. People can have MRSA even if they don't have an infection. When that happens its called MRSA colonization. A common place for MRSA colonization is the nose.
