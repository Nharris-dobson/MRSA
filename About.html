            We are SMASH Wharton scholars who are trying to help give a solution to a specific disease. We learned marketing, economics,
            computer science, math, biology, and design thinking. We then brought all these things together in the design
            thinking class where we learned how they could help us create an solution. We used this knowledge to create an
            effective solution to prevent a disease.

            Our mission is to decrease the number of people in Philadelphia hospitals getting MRSA. While doing that we also want to
            inform the public about the dangers of MRSA and teach them how to prevent it by doing things such as washing
            your hands.
