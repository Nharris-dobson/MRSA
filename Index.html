            <p id="paragraph1">
                Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, otherwise known as MRSA, is a contagious disease requiring treatment from medical professionals. MRSA is such a hard disease to cure because it is resistant to many antibiotics. Patients in hospitals may get infected with MRSA from tools that were not cleaned properly or doctors that don’t wash their hands well; you can also get MRSA from touching a person with MRSA or touching something that person touched.

                    Washing your hands is one of the most important things you can do to stop the spread of any disease. Using plain old soap and water might not seem like a lot but a little goes a long way. Washing your hands for about 30 seconds -which is just as long as it takes to sing happy birthday or your ABCs-  is a great way to kill germs.
